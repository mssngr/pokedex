# React Pokédex Challenge

## Instructions

1. Using this existing repo, bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, install dependencies with `npm i` and start the dev server with `npm run start`.
2. Fetch data from this open source JSON file (based on the PokemonGO game): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json (JavaScript's `fetch` or NPM's `axios` is suggested for the HTTP request)
3. Display the list of Pokemon however you like, making sure to show their “name,” “num,” “type,” and “weaknesses.”
4. Make this list searchable via a search box. (External NPM libraries for search are equally as good to use, here, as custom search implementations. Determine what works best for you.)

- For simplicity, just search through the names of the Pokemon, only.

5. Also, make this list filterable via the “type” and “weaknesses” fields.
6. Multiple filters should be able to be applied, and they should narrow the search, instead of expand it. This means that if I choose to filter for type “Grass” and type “Poison,” I should only get Pokemon with both the “Grass” and “Poison” types. This also means that if I choose to filter for type “Fire” and weakness “Ice,” I should only get Pokemon who are both “Fire” type and who have a weakness for “Ice.”

- Note: Any solution to achieve selecting multiple filters is fine. Checkboxes would work. Two dropdown selects would also work, as long as multiple options can be selected within. Or any other solution you can think of or pre-made React component from a library should be fine. You don’t need to win any gold medals in usability or design, here. The main thing I want to see is how you implement the filtering functionality, rather than how well you make it all look or feel.

## Bonus

If you have time for it, it’d be nice to see the following implementations. You won’t be negatively assessed if you do not have the next portions. It’s just a chance for us to see more of your code and get a more accurate gauge of your abilities.

1. Create a generic “Details Page” component for Pokemon, showing a pokemon’s:

- “name”
- “num”
- Rendered “img”
  - Make it so the user can actually see the picture, instead of the url
- “type”
- “weaknesses”
- “height”
- “weight”
- “prev_evolution” (if any)
  - (Bonus) Provide a link to the Details Page of the other pokemon being referenced
- “next_evolution” (if any)
  - (Bonus) Provide a link to the Details Page of the other pokemon being referenced

2. Provide a link or button to a pokemon’s Details Page from their listing in your master list. Also provide a Back button from the Details Page to return to the list.
